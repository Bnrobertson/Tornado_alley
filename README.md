# # Tornado_alley Project

This project aims to analyze tornado data over the past 50 years to determine if there have been any shifts in tornado alley and to examine changes in tornado intensity.

## Overview

The analysis is 

1. **Tornado Alley Shift Analysis:** Utilizing tornado data by year, we aim to visualize the geographical distribution of tornado occurrences to determine if there has been a shift in tornado alley over the past 50 years.

2. **Tornado Intensity Analysis:** We will explore changes in tornado intensity over time using various charts and statistical methods.

## Tools and Technologies

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Leaflet for interactive mapping
- Seaborn for statistical visualization
- Flask
- Postgres
- Python

## Data Source

The tornado data used in this analysis is sourced from two main datasets:

1. [National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/storm-event-data): The dataset used is the "Storm Events Database" provided by NCEI.

2. [Kaggle - US Tornado Dataset 1950-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danbraswell/us-tornado-dataset-1950-2021): This dataset contains tornado data for the United States from 1950 to 2021.
